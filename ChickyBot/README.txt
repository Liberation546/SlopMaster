ChickenBot readme and command list!
Thank you for allowing this terrible bot to be in your server, I am very flattered.

This bot is still a WIP, so if some commands do not work, or are not listed, it is because they are specific to my personal server.
This is also open-source, so if you see anything you'd like to modify, be sure to credit me if you push it to GitHub or elsewhere, it is highly appreciated!

Command List:
c$hi - ChickenBot replies with "Greetings".
c$die - ChickenBot replies with "Love you too {@userID}!"
c$lean - ChickenBot will send a video with an Asuka/Venom Lean Meme.
computer show me hell - Will send a gif of a skeleton burning in hell, be sure to thank computer afterwards!
c$activity - Listens to the senders screams as an activity.
c$cock - Sends a gif with a chicken.
c$chickengif - Sends a guy who is very excited to eat some chicken!
c$multichicken - Sends between 1-5 random pictures of fried chicken.
c$soy {@userID} - Pings the user with a soy bounce gif.
c$goodnight - A personal favorite :)
c$warn {@userID} - Sends a dm to the pinged user, warning them.
c$tuesday - Sends Out of Touch - Hall & Oates music video link
computer kill joe biden - Probably the most complex command, this one sends an image to your server, counts up by one, and checks if the number has reached a maximum.
Along with a bunch of stupid file shit.
c$reset - This increases the maximum by a random amount between 50-249.
c$play - Sets ChickenBot activity to playing a custom game of the senders choosing.
c$listen - Sets ChickenBot activity to listening to a custom song.

And those are all the commands you should be able to use! A lot of the files are hosted from my pc, so if my pc is shut off or if my wifi goes out,
then chances are some of the image commands won't work.

Remember, this is a WIP, so if you notice any bugs, feel free to email me: masonwells8@gmail.com or reach me by my Discord: Diglis#9553.
You can also join my server and ping me, I should be around most of the day, between 1-11PM US CST. Discord: https://discord.gg/JTnWRzeEy2
Have fun!
